//MindMath is a two-player game that challenges each players mental math ability and determines a winner based on most questions answered correctly. Each player has 30 seconds to answer as many questions as they can which can vary from addition, subtraction, multipication, and division. In MindMath each question is generated using a random combination of numbers and operators. A player successfully defeats their opponent if their score is the highest.

//MVP req
>Timer to end player's turn after 30 seconds
>Multiple rounds -make game object that holds p1 score, p2 score, round, depending on selection scores remain and round increase or refresh scores and round
>Logic to compare scores and determine winner
>Wide variety of questions all randomly generated
>Accurately display score
>Dom manipulation through jQuery

//Workflow

//Data structures=====================================
//Array to hold operators which will be selected at random to divide each side of the equation.
    > Ex:
    var $operators =
    [
      '/,,
      '*'
      '+'
      '-'

    ]

//Method of selection=====================================
  //Select question at random with sort array
  const randomGen = () => {
    var show = $hold[Math.floor(Math.random() * $hold.length)];
      console.log(show)

    var show_1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 12)
      console.log(show_1)


    var show_2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 12)
      console.log(show_2)

      $holder.push(show_1 + show + show_2)

    }

//Display selection on the dom=====================================

//rewrite prompts with input values
const myArray_2 = () => {
  let question = prompt($holder[0])
  let question_1 = parseInt(question)
    if(question_1 === parseInt($holder[0])) {
      console.log('success')
    } else{

console.log('you did it')
    }
}


//Let user enter input==========================================================================
  //If value of input = the parseInt of the question then player's score increases appropriately
